# Churn-Prediction-and-Pricing
Based on the data of the client, identify the main factors causing churn and visualize the effects of a pricing campaign on churn.

Along 5 complete tasks I had the opportunity to recreate a scheme of what a real datascience project looks like. From the start where one try to understand its client needs to the final presentation, passing by data exploration and Machine Learning, the experience is complete. 

Here is how the 5 tasks are distributed.

## 1. Business Understanding and Problem Framing

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data cleaning

## 3. Feature Engineering

## 4. Model Evaluation

## 5. Insights and Recommendation

To fully live the experience, I tried to respect the time constraint that were proposed.
